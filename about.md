Salt and Pepper Games is Simon Ever-Hale, Peter Stefek, Jonah Bregstone, and Samuel Grund.
After meeting near the start of their times at Oberlin College, their connection was instant.
That bond was solidified even further when, in the Spring of 2016, they developed Prism, a groundbreaking puzzle game.
Sadly, they didn't have the time to finish its development. Until now.
